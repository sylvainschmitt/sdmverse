description: "Runs ecological niche models over all combinations of user-defined
settings (i.e., tuning), performs cross validation to evaluate models, and
returns data tables to aid in selection of optimal model settings that balance
goodness-of-fit and model complexity. Also has functions to partition data
spatially (or not) for cross validation, to plot multiple visualizations of
results, to run null models to estimate significance and effect sizes of
performance metrics, and to calculate niche overlap between model predictions,
among others. The package was originally built for Maxent models (Phillips et
al. 2006, Phillips et al. 2017), but the current version allows possible
extensions for any modeling algorithm. The extensive vignette, which guides
users through most package functionality but unfortunately has a file size too
big for CRAN, can be found here on the package's Github Pages
