description: "A R-based toolbox for building species distribution models. The package prodives a user-friendly interface
to biomod, a widely used ensemble platform for species distribution modelling. In addition, it includes a wide variety of 
tools to explore and address collinearity of environmental data, correct geographic sampling biases in occurrence data
and delineate the training area. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows to explore, visualise, upload and download inputs/outputs.
It is designed to smoothly handle the navigation along the workflow by timely displaying a range of signal features to help communicate
various information. ShinyBIOMOD automatically creates a folder structure that saves outputs, thus ensures the trackability of inputs and
the portability of the results."
